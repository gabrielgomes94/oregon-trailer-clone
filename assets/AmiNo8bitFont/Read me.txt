AmiNo8bitFont.ttf by Neptune Ringgs

I recreated (redraw) this font from multiple NES games, pixel by pixel. So it's not me who invented it.

License:
The Sun will not swallow earth just because you used somebody's work in your projects, I'm fed up with this copyright crap.

Notes:
1- This font uppercase only, it works in any software that uses fonts (even in MS office, but it gives you a funny feeling).

2- Only a few symbols are in this font file, unavailable symbols may be replaced with some default fort.
